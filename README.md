# Link Shortener
A simple link shortener that has no purpose other than that. It is live at [short.ataberk.pw](short.ataberk.pw). 

## Configuration
Edit `config.js` file with your own preferences or needs.

I am using Nginx to listen the port 80 on the subdomain then proxy it to 3000 for Node.Js to use.

## Usage
Just run the `shortener.js`.
`> node shortener.js`
